# Algorithms

Writing great software requires a lot of things. Good communication, fast and
reliable tools, a bit of math, and a personal arsenal of common algorithms.

Recalling, practicing, and improving our algorithm knowledge is essential. I
set up this repository as a workspace for exercising commonly used ones.

The list is based on
[the algorithm list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms).
